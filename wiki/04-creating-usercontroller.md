# Created User Controller

Following MVC pattern, created a new package named `controllers` to create all
the controllers like users, products etc.

## User Controller

Created a NewUser as an entry point to the user controller, that is able to
call all the handler functions related to crud operations associated with it.

## Linking controller with main

Created an instance of userController, and used the different HTTP verbs
to perform crud operation on the object.
